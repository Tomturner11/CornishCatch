Cornish cuisine is known for its fresh seafood dishes that are packed with flavor, and my Cornish crab cake recipe is no exception. The delicious combination of sweet, succulent crab meat with a hint of spice and a crunchy exterior makes this dish a must-try for seafood lovers.

Cornwall's coastline provides the perfect setting for crab fishing, and many local fishermen have been perfecting their crabbing techniques for generations. The use of locally caught crab in this recipe is not only delicious, but it also supports sustainable fishing practices and the local economy.

These crab cakes are easy to prepare and make for a fantastic starter or main course when served with a fresh salad or creamy dipping sauce. Whether you're hosting a dinner party or simply looking for a tasty weeknight meal, these Cornish crab cakes are sure to be a hit.
