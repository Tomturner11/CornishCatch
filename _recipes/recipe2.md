Cornish mackerel is a versatile fish that is abundant along the coast of Cornwall. Its rich, oily flesh makes it an ideal candidate for grilling, and it pairs perfectly with a variety of vibrant and flavorful ingredients.

My recipe for Cornish Mackerel with Beetroot and Horseradish Relish showcases the bold flavors of this fish, combining it with the tangy sweetness of cooked beetroot and the sharp heat of horseradish. These flavors are brought together in a relish that provides a perfect complement to the delicate and flaky texture of the mackerel.

This dish is not only delicious, but it is also incredibly nutritious, as mackerel is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for maintaining good health. With this recipe, you can enjoy the benefits of this superfood while also indulging in a delectable and satisfying meal.

Whether you're a seafood lover or simply looking to explore new flavor combinations, my Cornish Mackerel with Beetroot and Horseradish Relish recipe is sure to impress.
